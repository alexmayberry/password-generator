# password-generator
A [LIVE](https://alexmayberry.github.io/password-generator/) password generator web app.

## Overview
App generates password based on password preferences of user.
- When 'Generate Password' button is clicked, user is prompted to enter password length in a popup prompt window and confirm the inclusion of different types of characters in popup confirmation windows.
- A string of the specified length is randomly generated using the specified set of characters.
- If the password length entered by a user is less than 8 or is non-numeric, an error message is sent and they are prompted again. 
- If the user does not choose at least one type of character to use in the password, an error message is sent and the prompts are sent again.

## Improvements
- I could add a copy button that would automatically copy the password to the user's clipboard.
